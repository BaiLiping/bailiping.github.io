##### Health:

1. No Sugar, in particular Fructose.
2. Limited salt intake
3. Intermittent Fasting
4. High Intensity Training
5. Metformin

##### Finance:

1. Aware/Avoidance/Hedging
2. lock-in structural imbalance/invariance/predictability
3. Phase Shift of liquidity.
4. Buy Commercial Retirement Plan and Insurance Plan

##### Social:

1. Leave room for the possibility that you are wrong. Things are dynamic and what you can see is just a small fraction of the reality.
2. At the end of the day, "JIA JIAO" is what matters.
3. Shut up on things you don't know.
4. Strike a Balance.
5. Only speaks up on the good side, but be aware of the downside. Perceived as a Pollyanna but in reality be Cathandra.

##### Learning:

1. Decompose a complicated system
2. Iterative Improvement/Bootstrap Vs. Hole in One
3. Go after things that is universal/applicable in other circumstances. i.e. invariant.

##### Heuristics/Thinking:

1. **Go with choices that give you the most options**.
2. When no enough information is there to compute expected return, decide based on the downside. (most people can only see the upside)
3. Secondary/Tertiary Consequences.
4. Always leave room for things/rationale you can't see.  

##### Ideology:

1. **Conservatism**: when changes are called for, what are the least drastic steps that can bring about such a change? Leave room for changes, but also don't be the gini pigs.
2. **'This is water'**: is basically Chinese philosophy stated by a white dude. Truth are those that cut through time and culture, maybe under different presentation formats.
3. When perfection is obtainable, go for it. If not, bootstrap is just as good.

##### Techniques:

1. **Risk**:
- Be aware of the risks involved in a project. Strike a balance between understanding the reality and being cynical and pessimistic.
- Prevention/Avoidance;
- Transfer;
- Alleviate;
- Pooling;
- Hedging;  
- Defensive strategy: If time is an issue, assume the worst and act accordingly. When you have enough time, design your steps carefully such that the information extraction is maximized every step along the way and decisions in later steps are better than does the previous ones.
2. **Reasoning**:
- induction, what must be true if i assume the logic is correct;
- false premise;
- boundary of a logic; dynamic/hidden;
- Ferminization/backward reasoning: what must happen to lead up to the desired final outcome.
3. **Detachment**: put aside your own emotions and feelings about things, but see the reality and act accordingly. Probably the best illustration of this is in sports and other high stacks circumstances.
