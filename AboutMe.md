Liping Bai is newly hired for the 2021 PhD position in Beihang University, School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering. She holds a master of engineering degree from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, College of Automation and AI.

Control Theory and Reinforcement Learning are misnomers in her mind. What they truly are, is the study of efficient information acquisition and sequential decision making concerning a stochastic dynamic system. She looks forward to her training with Beihang University and cultivating her expertise in merging classical control theory with multi-agent reinforcement learning.

For over 5 years, Liping Bai worked in the hospital investment sector where she forged an in-depth understanding of the Byzantine and ill-structured Chinese healthcare system. She provided due diligence reports to clients such as HCA Healthcare, Kaiser Permanente, UPMC and served as a third party provider to major consulting firms.
