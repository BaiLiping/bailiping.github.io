<p>How to Handle Uncertainly is probably one of the most important skill one squires along his and her journey.
  1. Understand that the circumstances changes over time.
  2. Even if there are uncertainty, there are still invariants that can be exercuted from where you are at that time step.
  3. The best bets are those that provide you with the most information for next steps, without costing you too much.
