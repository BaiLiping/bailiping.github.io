This project is the worst experience of my entire life. I've heard about the widespread mistreatment before, but this is the first time that I actually experience it. How can someone this moronic but this confident? That is beyond me.

What alarms me the most is how many bullshiters are there. They are the people make the most noise while the people who actually know things are too humble to say anything. This makes me want to short the stock of certain companies.
