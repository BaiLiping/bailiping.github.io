In retrospect, this project is the worst experience of my entire life. I've heard mistreatment from male to female colleagues, but this is the first time that I actually experience it. This experience is the closest I have ever been to been abused by someone who is not even qualified to conduct this project. How can someone this moronic be this confident?

What alarms me the most is how many bullshiters are there. They are the people make the most noise while the people who actually know things are too humble to say anything. This makes me want to short certain companies.

The fact that I was considered an employee to someone's personal company is beyond belief to me. I am the only labour in this project, yet people piggy backed for credit. This is beyond me.
